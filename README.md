# OS_Scheduling_Prog_ShortestExeTime1st
 Design a scheduling program that is capable of scheduling many processes that comes in at some time interval and are allocated the CPU not more that 10 time units. CPU must schedule processes having short execution time first. CPU is idle for 3 time units and does not entertain any process prior this time. Scheduler must maintain a queue that keeps the order of execution of all the processes. Compute average waiting and turnaround time.
